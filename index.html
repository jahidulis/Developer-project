            <p>You guys might have seen me drawing and sketching those beautiful artwork and doing romance with most
                prettiest woman. But neither did I got paid nor got any recognition for those. No even showed any
                concern
                that i had been drowned in this Atlantic for over a hundred years.
                That's why I decided to learn web development. I will keep learning until I can even make website for
                the
                Mermaid and the sharks.</p>
